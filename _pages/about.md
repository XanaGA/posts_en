    Hi, my name is Xavi! I am a Computational Maths Bachelor student, passionate about AI and Deep Learning since the first year of my degree. Specifically, I would like to apply the advances in this field to Computer Graphics, VR/AR, simulation, etc. Nevertheless, I love to explore new things, so my interests go from Brain Computer Interfaces to space exploration, ranging everything that includes technology and takes us closer to the future. I also love sports, discovering new countries and eating... I love food! With this blog, I hope to meet more people with my same interest so if you have any suggestions, doubts, ideas, or simply want to chat, don't think it twice, and drop me a line!ðŸ˜„
