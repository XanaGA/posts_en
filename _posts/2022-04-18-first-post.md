## The beginning
I have been self-learning about AI and Deep Learning since I started my degree more than three years ago. But lately, I had the feeling of being stuck, even a bit lost. Moreover, the idea of starting to share my work has always been in the back of my head. I think individually we can achieve cool things, but the big changes come from communities. We can find many examples just in the AI field, from Fastai to Hugging Face and many more. I want to be connected with those communities!🌍

Thinking about the best way to do it, I remembered what *Jeremy Howard* said about the importance of blogging in the second edition of one of the first [courses](https://course.fast.ai/) I took. Then I discovered Fastpages, so the decision was taken, I would start blogging!

## What you will find in this blog

With this work I want to share my work, the things I learn, and maybe my thoughts. It took me too long to start blogging because I wanted everything to be perfect, but this is not the idea. I will start my blog, it will be dynamic, things will change, there will be mistakes, and it never will be perfect. Beautiful, isn't it?

Together with AI (which is my true love😍), I'm trying to get into Computer Graphics, VR/AR, and simulation. For that reason, I am trying to learn about Geometric Deep Learning, Neural Rendering, and also Unreal Engine! 

Please remember this is a leaner's blog, you are encouraged to help, give suggestions, and correct me if I am wrong. Let's do this journey together!

## Why not in Spanish?

As you may have noticed, I'm not a native English speaker. In fact, my mother tongue is Spanish. So, why not write in Spanish. Well, there are a couple of reasons:

- I want to practice my English. Learn by doing!
- In English, I have access to a broader audience, so more people can help or share their ideas.
- And well... I have never said there won't be Spanish posts😉 I think with different languages we can target different audiences. So if I see some content is redundant or irrelevant in English, I will make it in Spanish.

So see you in the next one, adiós!👋
