    Welcome to my lab! Well, maybe it is a bit pretentious to call it a lab... for now, let's leave it as a playground. I will use it to document my journey through Deep Learning and its applications in VR/AR, computer graphics, BCI, etc. (<span style="font-family:'Courier New'">You can find more about my interests in the AboutMe section</span>). I am learning (I hope I always will be), so these posts aim to help me consolidate my knowledge and share my work with the community in case anyone can help me or, even better, it can be useful for someone. There is no point in keeping everything I learn for myself, so let's explore together!
