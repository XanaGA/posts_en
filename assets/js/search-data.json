But lately, I had the feeling of being stuck, even a bit lost. Moreover, the idea of starting to share my work has always been in the back of my head. I think individually we can achieve cool things, but the big changes come from communities. We can find many examples just in the AI field, from Fastai to Hugging Face. I want to be connected with those communities!üåç . Thinking about the best way to do it, I remembered what Jeremy Howard said about the importance of blogging in the second edition of one of the first courses I took. Then I discovered Fastpages, so the decision was taken, I would start blogging! . What you will find in this blog . With this work I want to share my work, the things I learn, and maybe my thoughts. It took me too long to start blogging because I wanted everything to be perfect, but this is not the idea. I will start my blog, it will be dynamic, things will change, there will be mistakes, and it never will be perfect. Beautiful, isn‚Äôt it? . Together with AI (which is my true loveüòç), I‚Äôm trying to get into Computer Graphics, VR/AR, and simulation. For that reason, I am trying to learn about Geometric Deep Learning, Neural Rendering, and also Unreal Engine! . Please remember this is a leaner‚Äôs blog, you are encouraged to help, give suggestions, and correct me if I am wrong. Let‚Äôs do this journey together! . Why not in Spanish? . As you may have noticed, I‚Äôm not a native English speaker. In fact, my mother tongue is Spanish. So, why not write in Spanish. Well, there are a couple of reasons: . I want to practice my English. Learn by doing! In English, I have access to a broader audience, so more people can help or share their ideas. And well‚Ä¶ I have never said there won‚Äôt be Spanish postsüòâ I think with different languages we can target different audiences. So if I see some content is redundant or irrelevant in English, I will make it in Spanish. . So see you in the next one, adi√≥s!üëã .",

          "content": "Hi, my name is Xavi! I am a Computational Maths Bachelor student, passionate about AI and Deep Learning since the first year of my degree. Specifically, I would like to apply the advances in this field to Computer Graphics, VR/AR, simulation, etc. Nevertheless, I love to explore new things, so my interests go from Brain Computer Interfaces to space exploration, ranging everything that includes technology and takes us closer to the future. I also love sports, discovering new countries and eating... I love food! With this blog, I hope to meet more people with my same interest so if you have any suggestions, doubts, ideas, or simply want to chat, don&#39;t think it twice, and drop me a line!üòÑ",
